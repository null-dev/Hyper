# What's in this folder?
This folder contains a fork of OpenTuring, a faster and more reliable version of Turing.

Several changes were made to OpenTuring to adapt it to this project's needs. The object limit has been raised and performance has been improved even further.

The original OpenTuring can be found here: http://tristan.hume.ca/openturing/.
